# www exploit

This is the exploit for the challenge. `requirements.txt` has the Python library necessary (`requests`).

`exploit.py` is the main exploit, send it IP address and port:

```
python2 exploit.py localhost:8080
```

The challenges relies on users being able to leak any file, particularly the `mydb.so` extension that queries the DB. So the exploit has a check for that (that it works).

The exploit itself doesn't require the leak of the extension, but that only happens if the check is correct.

## Important Note

The exploit compares the sha256 hash of the file returned with the original one, so if `mydb.so` changes then you MUST update `REAL_HASH` in `exploit.py`
